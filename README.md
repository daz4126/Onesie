Onesie is a tiny bootstrap app for Sinatra that crams everything all in one file:

* Models
* Views
* Routes
* Tests

Everything lives in a single folder - it is your views folder and your public folder. So just throw all your asssetts in there!

Pages are simple to create - just create a markdown file and it's address will be '/filename'. You can create your views inline in the onesie.rb file or as separate files.

Feel free to change the settings. Change the title and author.

To use it just clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:daz4126/Onesie.git
